This repo contains a Java class which checks if two or more texts are anagrams of each other, see class `Anagram`

There is a GitHub action set up that runs unit tests for the Anagram class, see file `build.yml`.
This action can be triggered manually, on every commit that is pushed and when a PR is created to the main branch.

You can find the generated javadocs in the folder `docs`
